## A microservices Project

This project is exactly what its name says: a project developed and built as a microservice architecture. 
The origin of this application is actually an internal project which was given to me as an exercise at 
Compass UOL. The provided pdf describes a common clothing store ecommerce composed by different services, 
each one responsible for a domain such as Customers, Products with categories and skus, Payments and more.

I developed the project using the pdf description of what it should be, but i also took the liberty 
of making some changes, sometimes in business requirements, sometimes in application design choices, either 
because it wasn't making too much sense as descripted, either because there were more interesting ways of 
doing stuff. 

As i developed this project as a study method, some design choices were made not thinking about a real situation
on which there would be much more stuff at stake, but simply because it would be cool to exercise some concepts.
At the same time, some concepts and techniques were being applied for the first time in my developer career so it 
is possible that they weren't good choices in the situations they were applyed in.
